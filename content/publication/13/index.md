abstract: "We describe two new 3=2-approximation algorithms and a
new 2-approximation algorithm for the minimum weight
edge cover problem in graphs. We show that one of the
3=2-approximation algorithms, the Dual Cover algorithm,
computes the lowest weight edge cover relative to previously
known algorithms as well as the new algorithms reported
here. The Dual Cover algorithm can also be implemented
to be faster than the other 3=2-approximation algorithms on
serial computers. Many of these algorithms can be extended
to solve the b-Edge Cover problem as well. We show the
relation of these algorithms to the K-Nearest Neighbor
graph construction in semi-supervised learning and other
applications."
