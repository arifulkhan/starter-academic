abstract: "Executing irregular, data-intensive workloads on multithreaded
architectures can result in performance losses and scalability
problems. Codesigning algorithms and architectures
can realize high performance on irregular applications.
A codesign study reveals four key lessons learned from
implementing matching algorithms on various platforms"
