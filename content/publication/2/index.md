abstract: "technologies have necessitated the handling of complex application objects
that are highly structured, large, and of variable length. Currently, such objects
are handled using filesystem formats like HDF and NetCDF as well as the
XML and BLOB data types in databases. However, some of these approaches are
very application specific and do not provide proper levels of data abstraction for
the users. Others do not support random updates or cannot manage large volumes
of structured data and provide their associated operations. In this paper, we propose
a novel two-step solution to manage and query application objects within
databases. First, we present a generalized conceptual framework to capture and
validate the structure of application objects by means of a type structure specification.
Second, we introduce a novel data type called Intelligent Binary Large
Object (iBLOB) that leverages the traditional BLOB type in databases, preserves
the structure of application objects, and provides smart query and update capabilities.
The iBLOB framework generates a type structure specific application
programming interface (API) that allows applications to easily access the components
of complex application objects. This greatly simplifies the ease with which
new type systems can be implemented inside traditional DBMS."
