abstract: "Reasoning about space has been a considerable field of study
both in Artificial Intelligence and in spatial information theory.
Many applications benefit from the inference of new
knowledge about the spatial relationships between spatial
objects on the basis of already available and explicit spatial
relationship knowledge that we call spatial (relation-
ship) facts. Hence, the task is to derive new spatial facts
from known spatial facts. A considerable amount of work
has focused on reasoning about topological relationships (as
a special and important subset of spatial relationships) between
simple spatial objects like simple regions. There is
a common consensus in the GIS and spatial database communities
that simple regions are insufficient to model spatial
reality and that complex region objects are needed that
allow multiple components and holes. Models for topological
relationships between complex regions have already been
developed. Hence, as the next logical step, the goal of this
paper is to develop a reasoning model for them. Further,
no reasoning model considers changes of the spatial fact basis
stored in a database between consecutive queries. We
show that conventional modeling suffers from performance
degradation when the database is frequently changing. Our
model does not assume any geometric representation model
or data structure for the regions. The model is also backward
compatible, i.e., it is also applicable to simple regions."
