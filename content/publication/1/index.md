abstract: "Abstractâ€”Existing state-of-the-art and web-based weather
event information portals, data archives, and forecast services
provide excellent subsetting and visualizations of weather events
and satellite sensor measurements. However, users only obtain
limited, simple, and hard-coded query, retrieval, and analysis
capabilities from these sources. One non-existent but desirable
capability is the accurate and efficient ad-hoc querying of
the trajectories of dynamic atmospheric events (e.g., tropical
cyclones, hurricanes) as well as the efficient retrieval of Earth
science satellite sensor data for these events based on ad-hoc,
user defined criteria and the event trajectories.
In this paper, we describe our current work and progress in the
development of a sophisticated framework based on the moving
objects database technology for ad-hoc querying and retrieval of
atmospheric events and their associated satellite measurements.
Such a capability is extremely important to scientists who process
sensor data of atmospheric events for statistical analysis and
scientific investigation."
