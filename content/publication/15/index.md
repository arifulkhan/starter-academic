abstract: "In this work, we leverage the Uber movement dataset for the Los
Angeles (LA) area where partial TAZ to TAZ (Traffic Analysis Zone)
trip time data is available, to predict travel time patterns on the
full TAZ to TAZ network. We first create a TAZ-TAZ network
based on nearest neighbors and propose a model that allows us to
complete the (O −D) (Origin-Destination) travel time matrix, using
optimization methods such as non-negative least squares.We apply
these algorithms to several communities in the TAZ-TAZ network
and present insights in the form of completed (O −D) matrices and
associated temporal trends. We qualify the error performance and
scalability of our flows. We conclude by pointing out the directions
in our ongoing work to improve the quality and scale of travel time
estimation."
